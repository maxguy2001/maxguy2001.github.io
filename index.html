            <h4>My name is Max Guy, I'm a 4th year Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of Edinburgh with my
                academice interests focussed mainly in the fields of data science, programming, statistics and computational mathematics.
                <br><br>
                I am the project manager for a software subteam at <a href="https://www.hyp-ed.com/">HYPED</a> where I focus on 
                the navigation of a pod which will be running through a vacuum tube at similar velocities to an aircraft. HYPED is 
                one of the most advanced and successful university teams of it's type. 
                <br><br>
                Recently in HYPED, my focus has shifted from the direct development of software to more of a mentorship/ development role for my team.
                While I still actively write and review code, I have been working more to further both the programming and wider skillset of my team. This has 
                involved teaching effective communication in a software development context and showing how to increase the overall quality of code.
                <br><br>
                My fourth year honors project involves building a fast linear programming solver from scratch in C++. This is designed for use in a compiler
                and so needs to be both reliable and relatively lightweight. My code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/maxguy2001/hons-project">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons and work on different data science projects that interest me. 
                I can comfortably write code in python, C++ and R however I am always excited to learn more!
