            <h4>My name is Max Guy, I'm a 4th year Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of Edinburgh with my
                academice interests focussed mainly in the fields of data science, statistics and computational mathematics.
                <br><br>
                I am the project manager for a software subteam at <a href="https://www.hyp-ed.com/">HYPED</a> where I focus on 
                the navigation of a pod which will be running through a vacuum tube at similar velocities to an aircraft. HYPED is 
                one of the most advanced and successful university teams of it's type.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time, I participate in various hackathons and work on different data science projects that interest me. 
                I write most of my code (especially for data science tasks) in python however I am also comfortable using C++ and R.
